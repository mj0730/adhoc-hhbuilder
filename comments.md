## Setup

No setup is required. `index.html`, `index.js`, and `main.css` just need to be located in the same directory, then open `index.html` in a browser.

## Notes

In the instructions, `Display the household list in the HTML as it is modified` was a little ambiguous. I understood it to mean the data is displayed to the user before submission, but it could mean update the displayed values as the user changes them. I used the latter in part of the validation logic, checking the values as they changed to display an error message to the user or not.
